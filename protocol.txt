Protocol

There are two types of requests, authenticated and unauthenticated.
Authenticated requests can only be made to nodes that accepted your node, and are encrypted.
Unauthenticated requests can be made to any node and do not use encryption.
Every node has a keypair they use to secure every authenticated exchange.

Generally, it is the client's job to remember most of the state during complex operations.
The server should be mostly stateless, except for the status of authentication.

A source folder is the reference data of a backup. An archive folder is a copy of a source.
The protocol does not allow a node to modify a source folder, only to read it,
but the protocol allows to read and write to an archive folder.
A node accepting another node grants the accepted node full control over this node's archives through the protocol,
as well as read-only access to its source folders.

All archives folder must be stored in <datapath>/archives/<sourcFolderPathHashed>
This folder contains subfolder 00..ff like a Git index would have.

# Authentication
To authenticate, send an Auth packet with your public key as data to a node while not already authenticated.
The node will reply with an empty Auth packet if successful, or with an Abort otherwise

# Syncing
The Sync request is authenticated, it asks the remote node to perform a sync of the given folder with all other nodes.
Since we can't just lock the filesystem, changes may happen in the middle of syncing a source with an archive
or two archives together. Thus, we need a syncing protocol that can cope with that.
To sync a local folder with a remote folder, the local client creates a list of local files, and asks the remote
to do the same. The client then compares the two and builds a diff.
The client then downloads every file that changed from the remote.
If the remote is unable to send a file because e.g. it was deleted or changed in the meantime, it sends an Abort.
The client ignores any Abort that happens while downloading a file.
After trying to download all the files in the diff once, the client generates another diff.
If that new diff is empty, the client stops syncing with this remote.
Otherwise, the client tries to download every file in the new diff again, until the diff becomes empty.
If the client receives an Abort while generating the diff (not while downloading a file), it stops syncing.
We must have a lastSyncedTime field on every file. The folder's lastSyncedTime becomes the oldest of the files.
When building a diff, we download a file if the remote's version is newer, and upload it if ours is newer,
so that after transfer the two files have the same lastSyncedTime.
When a node downloads or uploads a file, it must lock this file. Any request to read/write a locked file must fail.

# DownloadArchiveFile
Download a single compressed then encrypted file from a node's folder (source or archive).
All files in archives are compressed and encrypted, files in sources are in plaintext.
The server must compress and encrypt with its private key if it owns the source, or send the raw file if it has an archive.
The client sends the name of the folder and file to fetch, the server replies with the File metadata followed by content, or an Abort.
The actualSize field in the File metadata tells the client that it needs to deserialize actualSize-sizeof(File) bytes of content,
if the packet data size isn't equal to actualSize, the client should reject the packet.

/// TODO: Threading. Handle each client separately.

/// TODO: Faster exit after handling of a signal. Close all client sockets and get out now.
This implies making Server a real singleton, which it already is de-facto.

/// TODO: Change ndb/fdb to find their own path via settings, not ctor

/// TODO: Change Server to find its own path via the settings, not via contructor.
Maybe also give it ownership of ndb/fdb, and make it create them ?

/// TODO: If we're the source (and the target is an archive),
delete files we don't have that the remote still has.
The remote would do it itself if it was syncing,
so we should probably do it too if we're the ones syncing.
